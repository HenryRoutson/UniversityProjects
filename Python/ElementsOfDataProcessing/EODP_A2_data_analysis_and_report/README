# Introduction of intended use for code

    project_group126.py

    This file contains all code used for this project, to avoid any complexity involved in importing utility files
    It has a number of functions, including

        - data cleaning, integration and reduction. 
            - imputing
        - automatically generating all graphs combinations of the columns in our unified games data frame, which informed our analysis
        - training and evaluating a decision tree

    Some parts of the code are in functions if they are going to be used more than once, the imputer for example.
    The code is written to be highly generalisable and robust through the use of for loops to avoid hardcoding.


# File structure and use of each file
    NA

# Instructions on how to run your code.

    copy and paste
    python3 project_group126.py 
    into the terminal

    The code will ...
        - save a number of graphs, note it cannot overwrite ones of the same name
        - print off the decision tree structure and it's evaluation

# Any additional requirements needed to run code.
